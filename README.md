Big project executed with two other students in the beginning of first year studies. Exercise was to create Gas station program with UI. It was divided in three parts and each of us programmed our own part. 

Parts were: 

**1. Cash machine and gas indicator** 

     - Customer can see the gas prices (program reads from text file
     
     - Payment only by credit card (customer inputs pin code)
     
     - Create a way how customer decides how much gas is filled up
     
     - Program prints customers shoppings
     
     - Program decreases filled up gas from fuel tanks
     
     
**2. Price updating and billboard**

     - Prices are saved in text file(s)
     
     - Prices can be updated with own program
     
     - Prices are shown in the billboard
     
     - You can also add other ads to the billboard
     
     - There is a login in the program. Usernames are written in text file
     
     - Passwords are encrypted with MD5
     

**3. Fuel tanks (this was my part)**  

     - Fuel amounts are saved in a text file
     
     - You can see how much fuel there are in the tanks
     
     - You can order (/add) fuel into tanks with the program
     
     - Orders are written in text file, each on its own row with fuel type, ordered amount and date
     
     - If any of the tanks are in danger to empty, user gets a warning
     
     - There is a login in the program. Usernames are written in text file
     
     - Passwords are encrypted with MD5
     

We coded our own parts on our own (before we knew about github) and I merged them as one code.
