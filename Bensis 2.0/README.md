# Bensis 2.0

Project made with two other students. Exercise was to create a gas station program with UI and it was divided in three areas. 

Each of us had our own ares and we coded them on our own (before we knew about github) and in the end I merged them into one. 

These were mandatory areas of the program:


**1. Cash machine and gas indicator** 

     - Customer can see the gas prices (program reads from text file
     
     - Payment only by credit card (customer inputs pin code)
     
     - Create a way how customer decides how much gas is filled up
     
     - Program prints customers shoppings
     
     - Program decreases filled up gas from fuel tanks
     
     
**2. Price updating and billboard**

     - Prices are saved in text file(s)
     
     - Prices can be updated with own program
     
     - Prices are shown in the billboard
     
     - You can also add other ads to the billboard
     
     - There is a login in the program. Usernames are written in text file
     
     - Passwords are encrypted with MD5
     

**3. Fuel tanks (this was my part)**  

     - Fuel amounts are saved in a text file
     
     - You can see how much fuel there are in the tanks
     
     - You can order (/add) fuel into tanks with the program
     
     - Orders are written in text file, each on its own row with fuel type, ordered amount and date
     
     - If any of the tanks are in danger to empty, user gets a warning
     
     - There is a login in the program. Usernames are written in text file
     
     - Passwords are encrypted with MD5
     
   **In addition to these, I made some extra features:**
     
     - User gets a warning if he tries to order fuel more than the tanks capacity allows
     
     - After the order has been made, user can update the tanks capacity. This can also be done after customer has filled up
     
     - User can check order history and "print" it as well as delete it 
     
     - Order history window has a scroll bar
     
     - In the menu there are buttons for maintenance and logging out
     
   
**Grade: 5/5**
